# The iNUX Question Pools

This repository contain information and content for digital questions that can be used in various assessments.

The Question pools are accessible through the [iNUX Question Pools page](https://gw-inux.github.io/iNUX-Question-Pools/). This material is build up from this repository. They are not representing a final state. Rather, they likely will be enhanced and updated from the iNUX team, but also from the open source community. We are happy for contributions, and to get feedback.
